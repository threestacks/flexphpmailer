flexphpmailer
=============

Never write a php mail script for your contacct form again. Using jQuery and PHP it is flexible to be used with your contact form. Just add your email address and add any field to your contact form, it handles all names and stuff by itself. Bonus Ajax response built in
The repo has a mailer.php file that handles the data from Ajax and a mailer.js file that creates the data to be sent to php file.
A note of  caution, the response from the php has been printed to the console, it's recommended that you show it to the user
